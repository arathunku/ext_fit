<!-- @moduledoc -->

`.fit` file decoder. See `ExtFit.Decode` module for more details and usage.

It's still in alpha-release and there's a slim chance that the format of returned
structs will change but if possible, will be avoided.

Currently used FIT profile can be seen in `ExtFit.Profile.Types` file.

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `ext_fit` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:ext_fit, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

## Usage

```elixir
{:ok, records} =
  "my-file.fit"
  |> File.read!()
  |> ExtFit.Decode.decode()

# print first record
hd(record)
```

The docs can be found at <https://hexdocs.pm/ext_fit>.

FIT structs are very large, you might want to take a look at
[examples](https://github.com/arathunku/ext_fit/tree/main/examples) first!
